## Intro

Well first let me welcome you to this new year 2022! I wish you the best for this year and time to rock on and create and achieve what you most want! I welcome you to this new year with this new blog post! I haven't write an advice post in a while so let's get started!

## What is overthinking?
Overthinking is just the action to before doing something you think a lot of that action so you can excuse yourself to not do it, If you need to training, but before showering and getting ready you are already thinking "My pinky toe hurts a bit I should stay..." just getting excuses on top of your head to not do something that you don't feel like doing.

## How can it ruin your mindset?
Your mindset being the way you think, to make an action and make it your way, the way you tackle things and situations in life, how do you feel if something happens, this ruins your mindset completly in the way that if something bad happens, for example you are trying to leave tobacco and you smoke a cigarette and relapse, how do you feel about it? The first thought is regret,  and then the following thought is a strategy to leave it, but then you overthink it, while you think about it you are seeing the difficulty of it, the struggle you will have to pass, and that makes you thing to go out with a "blast" and so you light up another cigarette and say "this one is for good, my goodbye one" and cycles repeats.

But why? Because you didn't took action when you supposed to, the second thought being the strategy to leave tobacco, should be as easy as saying "I will not smoke tobacco anymore" and go on with your day, but instead you thought about what if, what am going to do if, and so on and so forth that you think that is too hard and just to not feel bad you light up another cigarette...

## How can we stop overthinking?
Is not easy, is a fight am going through a lot right now, but I can share some tips:
- Develop a "yes" theory
That being that every opportunity that you have to do something different, or a thought that came to your mind to cook something or just something you wanna do, just say "yes", and do it right away, don't think about tasks that you don't have to do, everytime you want to do something just say yes.

- Meditate
This is pretty self-explanatory, try to take some time of your day to meditate, could be in the shower, after having some exercise, as you wish, but take some time to think how you are going through the day, what you need to improve and essentially to take it with calm and with wisedom.

- Read a book
This certainly will teach you to not think twice, since reading a book is boring and difficult and you always put excuses for it, just grab it and read 5 pages, and that way you will develop an habit to just do what you need and want to do.

- Develop the right mindset
Be positive, notice your progress, be happy about it, listen to good music and enjoy the life that you have since there could be no tomorrow so enjoy it as it fullest, and don't let a little slip-up ruin your whole day, get the right mindset, know your goals, be honest with yourself and know what are you doing great and what you are not, make a plan and improve.

- Clean your room everyday
Everyday clean your room, your desk, mop the floor, tidy everything up, organize your things and develop the habit to do it every morning, it will make you feel good to go on with your other tasks.

## Outro
This are my 2 cents, I write this advices to myself but I know someone could need this and that's why I share them with you, if you know something and you don't share it, that's just being selfish right? hope you liked this post and I'll keep you updated!
