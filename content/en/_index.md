# Howdy everyone

I'm Said Neder, known as crazyc4t, and I'm a computer science student at Fraser International College (FIC) in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada! ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

I currently work as a I.T help desk in Centrum Concierge & Security Ltd. and hold the following certifications:
- AWS CCP
- CompTIA A+
- IELTS 7.0
- MET C1

I'm studying for my [Certified in Cybersecurity](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cc) certification made by [ISC\\(^2\\)](https://www.isc2.org/). 

(I passed! Got the [cert](misc/document.pdf), what should be my next certification?)

Expect lots of blogs about math, code, linux, and more!

You can find more about me in [my links](https://crazyc4t.xyz).
