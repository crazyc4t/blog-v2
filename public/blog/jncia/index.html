<content> <h1 id="my-journey-into-getting-jncia-junos-certified">My journey into getting JNCIA-JunOS certified!</h1>
<p>Hello guys it&rsquo;s crazyc4t once again, first of all happy new years!</p>
<p>I know I haven&rsquo;t been active lately but this will change, starting with my lack of networking skills, I must need to admit, I&rsquo;m not a fan of networking&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Why are you writing this blogpost then?</strong></p>
<p>First, let me get you in the context&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="my-story-with-networking">My story with networking</h2>
<p>As I said, I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of networking, doesn&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t like it, it&rsquo;s just that I prefer doing other things like ethical hacking and learn more about linux tho, but at one stage of ethical hacking I noticed the lack of my networking skills, since I understood everything that I was doing but very broadly, and I wanted to understand more deeply, so that&rsquo;s why I went my way to get the CCNA, started with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8W9oMNSuwo&amp;list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ">Jeremy&rsquo;s IT labs course</a> that is truly awesome really is a great resource but, for me it didn&rsquo;t clicked and just felt boring and not aligned with what I wanted, so I left CCNA and started studying a lot of stuff that lead me to not certify myself in months, in a blank space where I didn&rsquo;t knew where to go or to do, but I got a job in cybersecurity and it was awesome! And that made me acknowledge that I&rsquo;m good and I like cybersecurity and blue team operations, that is my thing!</p>
<p>But&hellip; the lack of networking when it&rsquo;s going to be fulfilled?</p>
<h2 id="why-not-the-ccna">Why not the CCNA?</h2>
<p>As I said, the CCNA is awesome and it holds really good value, but it is really expensive, because the exam itself is $300 dollars and there&rsquo;s good free training, as well as labs but if you want to get really great training and awesome practice tests and labs, for example from <a href="https://www.boson.com/certification/CCNA">boson</a>, the price justs adds up, including the official guide books and more.</p>
<p>And the CCNA is <strong>NOT</strong> a beginner level certification, since it really covers deeply routing and switching and handling of cisco devices, so it is a lot of content to cover, and I wanted a good fundamental level of networking, and also that is not going to break the bank.</p>
<h2 id="comptia-network-then-right">CompTIA Network+ then right!</h2>
<p>Not exactly, well the Network + covers a good level of networking, it is non-vendor specific, so you will know networking, but not specifically how to manage it on a CLI, also I don&rsquo;t like compTIA very much since their prices are elevated and also their certifications don&rsquo;t hold much value, only a few ones like the Sec + and the A +.</p>
<h2 id="juniper-comes-to-the-rescue">Juniper comes to the rescue!</h2>
<p>Juniper networks is a company that sells networking and cybersecurity solutions to businesses, and they have their own devices like switches, routers, firewalls and more, and they even have AI driven networks called &ldquo;Mist&rdquo;, isn&rsquo;t that awesome? Just to show you that they aren&rsquo;t a average joe in networking, they are a leader in wired and wireless infrastructure, competing with Cisco, Arista, Fortinet, Aruba just to name a few.</p>
<p><img src="/images/quadrantjuniper.png" alt="miau"></p>
<h2 id="juniper-certifications">Juniper certifications</h2>
<p>Now that I showed you that Juniper isn&rsquo;t a nobody in the networking space, their certification program is just AWESOME! there&rsquo;s no more ways to put it, why?</p>
<ul>
<li>They offer free training for every certification available for 6 months.</li>
<li>After finishing the training, they give you practice test and a evaluated test.</li>
<li>If you pass the evaluated test they give you a 75% DISCOUNT ON THE CERTIFICATION VOUCHER!</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can have a real networking certification, with free training and if you complete everythinig you have the voucher for $50 bucks? I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you should certify yourself as well as me!</p>
<p><img src="/images/certsjuniper.png" alt="certs"></p>
<p>This is the different levels and certifications they offer, and all follow the same program, that is &ldquo;JunOS Genius&rdquo;, the platform that offers the free training, so you have a variety of different areas you can select to study, in my case I&rsquo;m learning routing and switching, so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m preparring myself for the JNCIA-JunOS</p>
<h2 id="jncia-junos">JNCIA-JunOS</h2>
<p><img src="/images/jnciabadge.png" alt="jncia"></p>
<p>This certification is awesome since it teaches you the fundamentals of networking, subnetting and it teaches you more deeply while learning to configure juniper&rsquo;s switches and routers, with protocols like RIP or OSPF, and much more.</p>
<p>This will establish my desired networking knowledge learning-by-doing, and I can feel more confident now and experiment more deeply with networks.</p>
<p>On top of the free training, you have free labs! So what are you waiting for? I will upload my notes on my blog regurlarly and I&rsquo;m taking the test on february so I will keep you updated on how it went!</p>
